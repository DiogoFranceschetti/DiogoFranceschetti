⚙️ Techniques I Practice
- Data Extraction & Transformation: Using SQL to query databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and Python (Pandas) to clean and transform data.
- Data Visualization & Reporting: Building interactive dashboards and reports in tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Applying statistical methods and Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships in datasets.
- Database Management: Working with relational databases to design simple schemas, optimize queries, and ensure data integrity.
- Advanced Analytics: Creating predictive models and performing statistical analysis using Python (Scikit-learn).
- Communication & Storytelling: Presenting complex findings to non-technical stakeholders, translating data insights into actionable business strategies.
- Automation: Automating data pipelines and routine tasks using scripts or simple ETL tools to improve workflow efficiency.
